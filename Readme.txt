Hi, time is 5:46PM IST date 22nd June 2019 and This is the readme of the first ever simple blog that has been made by me,ofcourse.


This Blog is made as a personal project to implement the knowledge that i have gained in HTML and CSS only.


While Im still learning, Some of the things that have been used in making the blogs are as follow:


In this blog creation, only HTML and CSS is used.

Here and there is the use of CSS flexbox to center the content.

Using Color gradient to differentient between the two article.

Using 2 Blank social media icon at the end of an article.

Using Roboto as the default text font for the blog.

That's it for the day.
Hope you all will like it.
and have a nice day.
